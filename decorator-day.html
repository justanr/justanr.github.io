            <p><strong>An Aside:</strong> I originally wrote this as just a massive brain dump but
in retrospect, it wasn't helpful at all. In the process of preparing a
presentation for PyATL, I decided to rewrite it to be much more
informative and less example heavy. The original post was essentially
just a series of examples of <em>how</em> you'd use decorators or <em>what</em> you'd
use them for rather than <em>why</em> you'd use decorators and addressing
patterns. I'm hoping this rewrite clarifies that instead of being a
&quot;Look at all this code you probably don't understand!&quot;</p>
<p>Decorators are well championed but most posts I've seen about them don't
address many of the issues here. I wouldn't say they're something
beginner or novice friendly since it delves into concepts like
functional programming and &quot;higher order functions&quot; which is just scary
talk for &quot;functions that accept functions as arguments&quot; and even
currying, which basically boils down to &quot;reducing the number of inputs a
function takes.&quot; I'm grossly over simplifying here for the sake of
explaination, but I stand by these simplifications.</p>
<p>Another note, apparently there was a lot of hemming and hawing in the
Python mailing list when this construct (for lack of a better word) was
introduced because of confusion with the decorator design pattern. Given
that design patterns aren't my strongest suit (at least in terms of
knowing exactly what each does and how to best implement it), I think
there's quite of bit of one-to-one between the two on a basic level.
Each take in an object and modifies it in a way that the original
shouldn't be worried about. The decorator pattern seems to be more
concerned with adding data or processing information and is
compositional whereas Python's decorators seem to be more about removing
logic that, yes, is associated with the object in question but doesn't
need to be mixed directly with the actual logic of the object. That
makes it sound very confusing, but hopefully that will become clear
through examples and explaination.</p>
<div class="section" id="decorator-day">
<h2>Decorator Day</h2>
<p>This is meant to be a &quot;hit the ground running&quot; sort of thing decorators.
Just enough information to make you feel confident but not enough that
you know all there is to them. Though, honestly, once they click,
they're not so complicated.</p>
<p>I'm going to make the dangerous assumption that you have a decent grasp
on functions and how Python handles them. I'm going to briefly cover <em>a
bit</em> about that, but just what -- <em>I think</em> -- is requisite knowledge
for understanding decorators. If you're confident with the concept of
first class functions and closures, feel free to skip the next two
sections.</p>
<p>And just remember, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing; I'm giving
you enough rope to hang yourself here but not enough to build a bridge.
That comes with practice and exploration as well as digging deeper into
subject matter. Don't mistake me for a guru expert code ninja wizard
(though, I do hope to attain that title some day) as I'm in the mire
with everyone else.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="first-class-functions">
<h2>First Class Functions</h2>
<p>The first, and probably most important, piece of background knowledge is
that everything in Python is an <tt class="docutils literal">object</tt>. Everything. Functions,
Objects, Strings, and even Classes. This is what makes decorators
possible in Python. We can assign functions to new names, stuff them in
data structures, pass them as arguments to other functions and even
return them from functions. That's really all there is to first class
functions, they are treated just the same as anything else in the
language. And since methods are simply functions attached to a class or
object, the same applied to them as well. <tt class="docutils literal">str.join</tt> is just as first
class as <tt class="docutils literal">map</tt>.</p>
<pre class="code ipython3 literal-block">
<span class="n">my_func</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">dir</span>

<span class="n">funcs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">filter</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="nb">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">])</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">returns_func</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">dict</span>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="closures">
<h2>Closures</h2>
<p>The concept of closures scares a lot of people. But they're really
simple: closures are just functions defined inside of another function.
That's it.</p>
<p>But there's magic involved, too. Closures <em>close</em> over the available
outer scope and stuff it into their <tt class="docutils literal">__closure__</tt> attribute -- which
is just simply a tuple of cell objects that contain other things. This
is essentially a snapshot of the outer function when it's created.
Usually, the inner function is returned by the outer function.</p>
<pre class="code ipython3 literal-block">
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">adds_four</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">inner</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">y</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">inner</span>

<span class="n">o</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">adds_four</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o</span><span class="p">())</span>
<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="vm">__closure__</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<pre class="literal-block">
4
(&lt;cell at 0x7f26c154bd68: int object at 0x9f8860&gt;,)
</pre>
<p>The same logic applies to values passed into a function as well. When an
argument is passed into a function (say outer actually looked like
<tt class="docutils literal">outer(x=4)</tt>), those values become part of the scope of the function
as well and <em>are</em> available to closures for use if needed. Maybe I'll go
deeper into closures in the future, maybe not.</p>
<div class="section" id="an-aside">
<h3>An aside</h3>
<p>If you're wondering how Python knows what cell object to use well, my
understanding is that it doesn't and relies on the generated byte code
to do the right thing. But I could very well be completely wrong on this
matter.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="so-decorators">
<h2>So, Decorators</h2>
<p>Now we finally get to decorators. Decorators are functions that take in
a function, do something and return something -- typically a callable,
but it could be anything. Usually, decorators are used to either remove
extraneous logic from a function or to attach additional functionality
to it.</p>
<p>There's two ways to use decorators: the old way, pre-2.5, and the
special <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;decorator</tt> syntax. They do the same thing, like using
<tt class="docutils literal">list(1, 2, 3)</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">[1, 2, 3]</tt>, one's just syntatic sugar.</p>
<pre class="code ipython3 literal-block">
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">decorator</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">f</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">my_func</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="n">my_func</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">decorator</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">my_func</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># this is the old way</span>

<span class="nd">&#64;decorator</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">my_func</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;decorator</tt> syntax is the one you'll see in most cases.
Basically, what you're telling Python is when it's done creating
<tt class="docutils literal">my_func</tt> pass it to <tt class="docutils literal">decorator</tt> and then assign the result back to
<tt class="docutils literal">my_func</tt>. It sounds complicated to some, but it's really not.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">&#64;decorator</tt> is just a way of shorthanding your intention to the
interperter. And more importantly, it gives a heads up to people reading
your code that something more is happening behind the scenes. If you
manually wrap functions (which is needed sometimes), this can get lost
at the bottom of your function definition unless you make glaringly
obvious what's happening. This applies double to longer fuctions and
objects.</p>
<p>If you've got that down, you'll probably get the common patterns that
follow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="patterns">
<h2>Patterns</h2>
<p>There's plenty of patterns you'll encounter when working with
decorators. I'm hoping to identify some of the most common ones.</p>
<div class="section" id="pass-through-decorators">
<h3>Pass Through Decorators</h3>
<p>Basically, this is a decorator that takes in an object, does something
and returns the original object. It might register it somewhere, gather
some information about or add an attribute to it.</p>
<pre class="code ipython3 literal-block">
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">pass_through</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">inspected</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">True</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">f</span>

<span class="nd">&#64;pass_through</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">thing</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Thing()&quot;</span>

<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="nb">hasattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">thing</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'inspected'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">thing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">'thing'</span>
</pre>
<p>It's common enough but usually they're not doing anything too exciting
or surprising. But it's definitely worth distinguishing it from
decorators that use closures.</p>
<p>The rest of the patterns I'm going to cover are all function closure
oriented, except for two which will be obvious.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="flexible-decorators">
<h3>Flexible Decorators</h3>
<p>You're going to want your decorators to work with as many functions as
possible. Not just the one you initially noticed and thought, &quot;I can
factor this other code out into a decorator.&quot; But what does a flexible
decorator look like? It's best to compare it to a brittle decorator to
understand fully.</p>
<pre class="code ipython3 literal-block">
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">brittle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">wrapper</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">arg2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">kwarg1</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">kwarg2</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">arg2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">kwarg1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">kwarg2</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">wrapper</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">flexible</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">wrapper</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">wrapper</span>
</pre>
<p>What's so important about this that we end up using <tt class="docutils literal">wrapper</tt> when we
call a decorated function. If we used the first example, the brittle
one, we'd have to write every function we decorate with it to accept
four arguments. Where as the second example, the flexible one, can
accept any number of positional or keyword arguments.</p>
<p>To give a concrete example...</p>
<pre class="code ipython3 literal-block">
<span class="nd">&#64;flexible</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">dinner</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">food</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">beer</span><span class="p">):</span> <span class="c1"># &lt;- becomes wrapper</span>
    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Eating'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">food</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'and drinking'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">beer</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">dinner</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'bratzel'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'azazel'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># &lt;- actually wrapper</span>
</pre>
<pre class="literal-block">
Eating bratzel and drinking azazel
</pre>
<p>I'm a little homesick for Memphis. If you're ever there, I'd recommend
the Flying Saucer downtown. Anyways...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preserving-metadata">
<h3>Preserving metadata</h3>
<p>When you lock your original function up in a closure, you lose the
original metadata: <tt class="docutils literal">__name__</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">__doc__</tt>, etc. There's a few ways to
retain it. Instead of hopping to the correct way, I'll show you why
you'll want to do that instead. Just like ensuring defaults are set in a
dictionary, there's an increasing level of &quot;correctness&quot; or &quot;Pythonness&quot;
from what you should start with and what you should end with.</p>
<p>The first thing you might try is manually transfering these attributes
inside the decorator.</p>
<pre class="code ipython3 literal-block">
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">loggit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">logger</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Calling </span><span class="si">{}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="vm">__name__</span><span class="p">))</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">logger</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="vm">__name__</span>
    <span class="n">logger</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="vm">__doc__</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="vm">__doc__</span>
    <span class="n">logger</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="vm">__dict__</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="vm">__dict__</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">logger</span>
</pre>
<p>Other than the fact that we're missing three crucial attributes, this is
a terrible way to migrate attributes. You'll have to do this in every
decorator you write -- meaning it'll be no fun to maintain when a new
attribute is introduced. This is very similiar to the basic idiom of
checking if a key is in a dictionary before we do something with it:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
if something not in my_dict:
    my_dict[something] = [value]
my_dict[something].append(value)
</pre>
<p>Well, decorators are good at removing extraneous code from a function,
let's try writing a decorator decorator -- as confusing as that sounds,
it's pretty common, so we're catching two pythons with one net.</p>
<pre class="code ipython3 literal-block">
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">decorator_decorator</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">deco</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">wrapper</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">g</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">deco</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>That's <em>almost</em> better. Except it's really ugly. Like <em>really</em> ugly. And
actually, I find it more confusing than helpful. When I initially wrote
this code it was as an example of what <em>not</em> to do and it's here for
that same reason. It requires you to think on multiple levels at the
same time, which is great if you're just trying to anger people looking
over it. This <tt class="docutils literal">decorator_decorator</tt> is pretty benign if you're
comfortable with what each piece means and works. But if you're doing
this in your code, unless you're having to work with 2.4 or below,
you're doing it the wrong way.</p>
<p>This is most akin to using <tt class="docutils literal">dict.setdefault</tt> to ensure a value is
present in a dictionary, and just like that method, I find it confusing
every time I look at it (though, there are <em>many</em> times when it's
useful):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
grouping = my_dict.setdefault(something, [])
grouping.append(value)
</pre>
<p>However, Python is batteries included and comes with something that
handle this for us. Enter <tt class="docutils literal">functools.wraps</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">functools.update_wrapper</tt>. <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;wraps</tt> is just the decorator form of
<tt class="docutils literal">update_wrapper</tt> -- using a decorator to create decorators seems
counter intuitive, but it's really not and <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;wraps</tt> is a testament to
it's power and another example further down delves a little deeper. But
<tt class="docutils literal">update_wrapper</tt> is pretty simple, it merely:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Copies needed attributes from the original function to the new<ul>
<li>This includes the name, docstring, module, qualified name and
module attributes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updates the wrapper's dict with the original function's dict</li>
<li>As of 3.2, it also supplies a <tt class="docutils literal">__wrapped__</tt> attribute that contains
the original object<ul>
<li>It doesn't appear that this was backported to Python 2 at all. I'd
seriously recommend monkey patching update_wrapper to handle this
for reasons that'll become obvious later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">update_wrapper</tt> is also smart enough to not blow up if one of these
attributes isn't present on the underlying object (such as <tt class="docutils literal">__name__</tt>
on an instance of an object).</p>

<p>In case you're wondering, the parens are required because we need to
call the outermost function, which generates the decorator which in turn
generators the wrapper function we're actually using. To be 100% honest,
outside of a handful of cases, I find this particular implementation to
be lackluster because usually the outermost function just serves to pass
information one level deeper.</p>
<p>However, one of the best arguments for using this particular pattern is
passing positional arguments to a decorator. This has more to do with
how Python handles unpacking into functions than anything else. But
using an outer function like this is certainly the easiest way I've
thought of to handle positional arguments to a decorator. You <em>could</em>
fiddle with pushing the fuction to the front of <tt class="docutils literal">*args</tt>, but I feel it
would quickly become messy.</p>
<p>Back to optional kwargs, instead of having an outermost function that we
must explictly call, why not use <tt class="docutils literal">functools.partial</tt> and setup a
little check?</p>

<p>That's actually a lot better. The most interesting thing here is how
using partial allows us to for go the parens when we don't overide
keyword arguments. Since we're accepting only one positional argument
(via Python 3's keyword only syntax, there's not really a good way to
imitate this is Python 2 other than using positional arguments sparingly
when calling a function), when Python puts the function into the
decorator, it does it positionally. We don't need to call the outermost
function explicitly because Python will call it for us. And if we need
to override a keyword argument, we can call the function explicitly to
do so.</p>
<p>However, we've just moved our primary concern inside the decorator and
it's creating noise. Moreover, if we decide that this is the best thing
in the world, we'll be copying that code into every decorator we write.
And six months from now, when partial is considered as terrible as
<tt class="docutils literal">GOTO</tt>, we'll have to replace all these instances (though, you can
never take my partials from me!). I'm not sure if that's better or worse
than before.</p>
<p>We're already writing a decorator, and we're getting pretty good at
them, so why not a decorator that'll handle this for us? This is
probably the most confusing example, so hold on:</p>

<p>This looks really complex and intimidating, but it's really not when you
get to understand decorators. All we've done is factor out the code
<tt class="docutils literal">print_before</tt> shouldn't be concerned with, namely if it actually
recieved a function or not. What happens is that we replace
<tt class="docutils literal">print_before</tt> with the closure inside <tt class="docutils literal">optional_kwargs</tt>. This
closure handles the logic of ensuring that a function was passed or not.</p>
<p>The true power of this becomes apparent when you replace the print
statement with something that will preprocess inputs for you: escaping
characters or changing integers and floats to <tt class="docutils literal">Decimal</tt> if you're
working with financial data. Here, it's simply to illustrate <em>how</em> you
would implement the pattern.</p>
<p>Like the horrible <tt class="docutils literal">decorator_decorator</tt> example above, this sort of
code forces your brain to operate on multiple levels at the same time.
Once you're comfortable with it, this makes quite a bit of sense as to
why you'd do it. However, before that, it merely causes a headache.</p>

<div class="section" id="using-classes-as-decorators">
<h3>Using classes as decorators</h3>
<p>Sometimes a function closure doesn't provide the <em>umph</em> needed to do

<p>When using a single instance per wrap, you need to first store the
wrapped obj on the instance (<tt class="docutils literal">self.f</tt>) and then when you need to call
it, you simply pass it arguments. Fairly straight forward, but it's
pretty contrived example as well. This sort of pattern would be used
when your logic becomes much more complex than what a simple function
should reasonably handle, things like transcieving data to an event loop
or socket for example or creating individual caches for each object.</p>
<p>Let's look at using a single instance to wrap multiple objects.</p>
<pre class="code ipython3 literal-block">

</pre>
<p>This is essentially the same thing as using a function closure as a
decorator, except it comes with the extra <em>umph</em> that comes with using
an object as well. This sort of pattern would be used for linking
several objects together in a shared state, a rudimentary messaging
queue should be easy to write with this sort of pattern. Your
<tt class="docutils literal">__init__</tt> method in this case would set the initial state for the
object rather than accepting the function there.</p>
<p>And of course, you don't have to use <tt class="docutils literal">__init__</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">__call__</tt> to
register and run functions, you can create other methods that would
handle these as well. <tt class="docutils literal">register</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">run_wrapped</tt> for example could
easily do the same thing.</p>
<p>If you're wrapping multiple objects with the same instance, it may be
helpful to also use some sort of data structure to organize them if
you're doing more than simply wrapping them. In most cases the
<tt class="docutils literal">weakref</tt> module will either provide the answer you need or set you on
the right path; though, there are objects that can't be weak referenced
-- including most of the built in or &quot;primitive&quot; types in Python (str,
int, float, list, dict and tuple). However, for more complex objects,
weakrefs are a powerful tool that let you conserve memory among other
things. It's worth balancing using something like <tt class="docutils literal">WeakKeyDictionary</tt>
versus a regular dictionary for caching.</p>
<p>I got sidelined, anyways...</p>

<div class="section" id="decorating-classes">
<h3>Decorating Classes</h3>
<p>As of Python 2.6, decorating classes is also supported. There's all the
same reasons you'd want to decorate a function with the added benefit
that you can apply metaclasses uniformly between Python 2 and 3. Or
maybe it's just simpler than writing a metaclass in the first place.
This next example comes from the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kelp404/six">six.py</a> project and allows you to
decorate a class to be applied in Python 2 and 3.</p>
<pre class="code ipython3 literal-block">

<div class="section" id="applying-multiple-decorators">
<h3>Applying multiple decorators</h3>
<p>This generally works. Especially if you've used <tt class="docutils literal">wraps</tt> or
<tt class="docutils literal">update_wrapper</tt> consistently. The important thing to note here is
that decorators are evaluated from the bottom up. The first thing that
happens is that Python defines the original object, then it walks up
each decorator, passing the return value from each to the next
decorator. That's pretty much all there is to stacking decorators,
except for one thing that I'll cover in the next section.</p>
<pre class="code ipython3 literal-block">
<span class="nd">&#64;wrapperobj</span>
<span class="nd">&#64;print_before</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">random</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">4</span>

<span class="n">random</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre>
<pre class="literal-block">
Setting up!
</pre>
<pre class="literal-block">
4
</pre>
<p>One nice thing is if you remember to use <tt class="docutils literal">wraps</tt> or
<tt class="docutils literal">update_wrapper</tt>, Python will very helpfully pass along added
attributes as well (since they are really just key-value pairs sitting
in <tt class="docutils literal">__dict__</tt>). In case you forgot, <tt class="docutils literal">pass_through</tt> is the first
example in this section, it merely adds an attribute called
<tt class="docutils literal">inspected</tt> to an object.</p>
<pre class="code ipython3 literal-block">
<span class="nd">&#64;wrapperobj</span>
<span class="nd">&#64;pass_through</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">random</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">4</span>

<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="nb">hasattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">random</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'inspected'</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre>
<pre class="literal-block">
{'__annotations__': {}, 'f': &lt;function random at 0x7f26c0039d08&gt;, '__qualname__': 'random', '__wrapped__': &lt;function random at 0x7f26c0039d08&gt;, 'inspected': True, '__doc__': None, '__module__': '__main__', '__name__': 'random'}

<div class="section" id="issues-and-problems">
<h2>Issues and Problems</h2>
<p>As with anything, there are certain problems and issues you'll run into.
Decorators are no exception. At some point, at least one of these will
bite you, maybe hard.</p>
<div class="section" id="stacking-wrong">
<h3>Stacking wrong</h3>
<p>This is something that will happen more often then you think. However,
as long as you remember that they're evaluated from the bottom up and
you've used <tt class="docutils literal">wraps</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">update_wrapper</tt> through out, you'll
probably be okay. Sometimes, it's important to note which decorators
allow an object to pass through and which lock the object in a closure
-- you <em>shouldn't</em> have to, but at least once you will.</p>
<p>However, there is something to be said for the <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;property</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">&#64;classmethod</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;staticmethod</tt> decorators. These return
<strong>*descriptors*</strong> which are a slightly different sort of object that
behave in a peculiar way. I've gone into detail about them else where,
but the rule of thumb is to always apply these decorators last.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>This is something of a sticky point. Pass through decorators are easy to
test, those wrapped objects aren't hidden away anywhere. However, you're
far more likely to encounter a closure decorator which makes testing
much harder.</p>
<p>The easiest way is to use the <tt class="docutils literal">__wrapped__</tt> attribute if it's
available. Python 3.4 does provide a very nice function in <tt class="docutils literal">inspect</tt>
called <tt class="docutils literal">unwrap</tt> which continually unravels a decorated function until
it's no longer wrapped up.</p>
<p>But if neither of these are available to you, and you're decorator does
something like connect to a database or ensure a user's logged in, you
might be in for a head ache.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introspection-and-blowing-stuff-up">
<h3>Introspection and blowing stuff up.</h3>
<p>More than once I've been bitten by bad introspection (looking at you,
Google API wrapper), thankfully it was <em>only</em> me manually inspecting a
function to see how to use it. Even using <tt class="docutils literal">update_wrapper</tt> isn't
enough to solve this problem.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Argument specification</li>
<li>Closely related is annotations in Python 3</li>
<li>Ability to pull source code</li>
<li>type and isinstance stop working</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll admit blowing up code is one of the ways I learn the best. &quot;What
did I do that I shouldn't have done and how do I fix it?&quot; Though,
sometimes the errors are hard to track down.</p>
<p>Python 2's <tt class="docutils literal">inspect.getargspec</tt> doesn't like being passed an object
and complains loudly about it. Python 3's version doesn't seem to mind,
though take that with a grain of salt because I'm sure there's a corner
case somewhere that blows it up. Python 2 will display the argument
specification and source code of the wrapper. Python 3 <em>seems</em> to do the
right thing (at least in 3.4, and this may be because of
<tt class="docutils literal">inspect.unwrap</tt> and the <tt class="docutils literal">__wrapped__</tt> attribute).</p>
<p>Wrapping classes can seriously put a kink in your inheritance pattern if
you're not careful about it. If your class simply passes through the
decorator, you'll be okay. If it doesn't, you need to take care to make
sure to either return the actual class (most likely using descriptors)
or use something like <tt class="docutils literal">__wrapped__</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">inspect.unwrap</tt> in your
inheritance line, both are which are ugly.</p>
<p>Similar to inheritance, <tt class="docutils literal">isinstance</tt> isn't too happy about having a
function passed to it. This behavior looks consistent between Python 2
and 3. The same fixes should apply here.</p>
<p>The final thing, which I'm unsure about fixing, is using <tt class="docutils literal">type</tt> to
identify explicitly what an object is. Descriptors seems like they
should work and rudimentary testing with it seems to cause <tt class="docutils literal">type</tt> to
behave as expected, but I've not battle tested this -- and the real
question is, &quot;Why are you using <tt class="docutils literal">type</tt> anyways?&quot;</p>
<div class="section" id="actually-fixing-these">
<h4>Actually fixing these</h4>
<p>If you're much more curious about the proper way to fix these issues, I
highly recommend Graham Dumpleton's blog series <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2014/01/how-you-implemented-your-python.html">How you implemented
your Python decorator is
wrong.</a>
which goes into so much more depth than I have here and really opened my
eyes to what I was actually doing when writing decorators beyond just
stuffing one function inside of another. It also serves as a decent
introduction into how descriptors work and practical uses of them.</p>

<h2>No Man is an Island Unto Himself</h2>
<p>This post wouldn't have been possible without the writings of Graham
Dumpleton (sourced above), <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/11/29/improve-your-python-decorators-explained/">Jeff
Knupp</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://simeonfranklin.com/blog/2012/jul/1/python-decorators-in-12-steps/">Simeon
Franklin</a>.
All three of these -- as well as countless other blog posts and
StackOverflow questions -- introduced me and explained what decorators
are to me. I'd also like to give thanks to both PyATL and Doug Hellman
for sparking my interest in giving a presentation as well as the online
learning group I'm a member of for sitting through about forty minutes
of me listening to the sound of my own voice and asking for
clarifications on <em>many</em> things I glossed over initially, thinking that
people think the same way I do (which is probably a lot more twisted and
convoluted than most).</p>
<p>I'm probably going to rewrite several other posts as well in a more
frank &quot;This is what's happening&quot; manner instead of the usual &quot;Here's a
bunch of code, I hope you get it!&quot; that makes sense to me more than
anyone else.</p>
